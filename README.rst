Hutch is a media storage framework for django-couchdbkit projects.

The goal of Hutch is to allow for different ways to handle media in a django project using couchdbkit.

1.  Retrieve and use media from existing attachments to couchdbkit documents
1.  Handle any media type to any document type for couchdbkit models
1.  Do easy thumbnail/media display of said attachments in couch

Requirements:
couchdbkit
sorl-thumbnail

* About the name:  Traditionally on an office desk some of them offer a media storage unit shelf to go over the shelf, called a hutch, hence the use of the furniture pun.
